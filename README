Kivabeta
--------

Kivabeta is a project to leverage the vast talent of developers across the world to add new and more powerful searching and lending features on top of the Kiva API.

How does this help Kiva
-----------------------

Kiva has many requests for new features that would make lending on the site easier or more engaging. Unfortunately, we don't often have time to implement such features. Also, unfortunately, we don't have much of our code open-sourced yet. This leaves us unable to enable people to help us in the ways they would like to  Kiva Beta gives us a chance to put some code out there that can go on Github and then on the Kiva site if it proves useful, can be merged back into our code base. In addition to making the site better, this should help us work towards open sourcing more of our code.

Kiva engineers highly appreciate all the help. For more information on working with the Kiva API for your own projects, check out http://build.kiva.org
